Version 1.0 Released &gt;&gt;&gt;</b><br /><br />Fixed a bug that caused multiple previews not to work correctly on feathered, non-floating selections.<br /><br />If running on a system localized to a country that uses the metric system, the default unit for image dimensions changes from inches to cm.&nbsp; Resolutions (pixels/inch, lines/inch, dots/inch) still default to English units.<br /><br /><b>&lt;&lt;&lt; Version 1.0 International &gt;&gt;&gt;</b><br />Modified Photoshop to read the incorrectly formatted LZW compressed TIFFs sometimes written by version 1.0 of Photoshop, with no loss of data.<br /><br /><b>&lt;&lt;&lt; Version 1.0x1 &gt;&gt;&gt;</b><br /><br />Fixed the bug that was sometimes causing Photoshop to incorrectly format LZW compressed TIFF and GIF files.&nbsp; This version can also read all TIFF and GIF files written by version 1.0 of Photoshop with no loss of data.<br /><br /><b>&lt;&lt;&lt; Version 1.0.1 Released &gt;&gt;&gt;</b><br /><br />Photoshop can now read PixelPaint format files created by PixelPaint version 2.0.<br /><br />After deleting the only alpha channel of an RGB image, the displayed channel is now switched to RGB rather than blue.<br /><br />Fixed a number of bugs, caused by the PMSP, where Photoshop was deleting files in the system folder when creating files of the same name elsewhere.<br /><br />The "Stretch" effect has been renamed "Stretch/Shrink".<br /><br />The temporary file been renamed "PS Temp" (from "PS.Temp"), and now has a custom icon.<br /><br />Improved the error message if Photoshop is unable to open the temporary file.<br /><br />Undo is killed and virtual memory is compressed before calling a plug-in acquisition module.&nbsp; This allows the plug-in to accurately determine the maximum size image that can be scanned.<br /><br />Fixed a bug where Photoshop would sometimes not save to multiple disks if replacing an existing file.<br /><br />The transfer function is now included in the master file of a DCS (five-file) EPS set.<br /><br />The transfer function is now prepended to the printer's existing transfer function.&nbsp; This should make Photoshop compatible with PostScript density calibration utilities.<br /><br />All slider controls now respond to mouse downs anywhere along their length.&nbsp; The nearest triangle jumps to the mouse down location.<br /><br />When saving a less-than-72dpi EPS file with an 8-bit preview PICT, the preview PICT is no longer up-sampled to 72dpi.<br /><br />The "Monitor Gamma" field in the gray scale transfer function dialog has been renamed 'Image Gamma', to distinguish it from the field in the separation setup dialog.<br /><br />An 'Image Gamma' field has been added to the color transfer function dialog.&nbsp; It is required because the color separator now longer converts images to gamma 1.0 during separation, but instead leaves them at the monitor's gamma.&nbsp; The net result is improved dynamic range, with less contouring in the shadow areas.<br /><br />The upper bound of the legal range for gamma values has been increased from 2.0 to 2.2.<br /><br />When measuring CMYK values on the gray scale image, the percent readout on the K channel is now adjusted for the current monitor gamma.<br /><br />Photoshop now uses a much higher resolution table when converting from RGB to CMYK.&nbsp; The new table takes about 3 minutes to compute (the previous table took only 20 seconds).&nbsp; So, to avoid slowing down every color separation, the most recently used table is stored in a file named 'PS Table' in the preferences folder.&nbsp; If the separation setup has changed since the last separation, the table is automatically recomputed.<br /><br />The clipping performed by the color separator to meet the 'Total Ink Limit' now adds black to compensate for the extra undercolor removed.<br /><br />There is a new field in the separation setup dialog, called 'Undercolor Addition'.&nbsp; It is used to reduce the amount of undercolor removal in the very dark areas.</span></span></blockquote><span class="" id="result_box" lang="it"><span class="hps"><br /></span></span><span class="" id="result_box" lang="it"><span class="hps">Il sorgenti in questione è scaricabile da <a href="http://computerhistory.org/atchm/photoshop-license-agreement/" target="_blank">questo link</a>, buon divertimento!</span></span><br /><br />
