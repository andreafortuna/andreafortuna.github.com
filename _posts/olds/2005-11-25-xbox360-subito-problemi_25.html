<p>Non ditemi che <a href="http://andrea.ariellab.org/?p=28">tratto male</a> Xbox360:  manco a farlo apposta, a pochi giorni dall&#8217;uscita negli USA, i forum dedicati alla console Microsoft sono stati inondati da segnalazioni di malfunzionamenti.</p><br/> <p>In <a href="http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=462099">questo thread</a> su <a href="http://www.xbox-scene.com/">xbox-scene.com</a> sono gia&#8217; 12 le pagine di messaggi di utenti insoddisfatti/preoccupati.</p><br/> <p>Le problematiche sembrano essere di varia natura: </p><br/><br/> <p>il lettore DVD della console che graffia i dischi</p><br/> <blockquote><p><em>actually just picked mine up from best buy brought it home put in some need for speed played it for i dont know about 10 minutes and in the middle of a race it just hung and the screeen scrambled. so i shut the system off and ejected the disc and seen that now my brand new game is completely scratched with like 6-7 rings all the way around</em></p></blockquote><br/> <p>blocco del sistema</p><br/> <blockquote><p><em>I got to play PDZ for under five minutes before my 360 froze. When/if I turn it back on with or without game inserted I get red lights in sectors 1,3, and 4. I called MS and was told this indicated a hardware failure. After the brilliant tech support told me I should just restart it and call back if it happened again, I was afraid we would get nowhere fast. I then explained that my 360 would not turn back on and was now only a $400 piece of plastic that blinked red lights at me.</em></p></blockquote><br/> <blockquote><p><em>All my games freeze about 15-20 mins into them. Sending it back to MS when the return box comes. So much for my Thanksgiving weekend of gaming.  </em></p></blockquote><br/> <p>svariati messaggi di errore</p><br/> <blockquote><p><em>ugh 3 hours in playing COD2 and Amped3 and I go the black screen of death and now it won&#8217;t recover.<br/><br/>I turned off the game with the contoller and now it won&#8217;t start up (it goes straight to the black Error 74 screen)</em></p></blockquote><br/> <blockquote><p><em>I am getting these errors 64 &#38; 65 Call customer service&#8230;anyone else getting these errors???<br/><br/>I just got a 360 after 12 hours of waiting at walmart.I got home hooked it up chatted for 10 min shut it down.Booted back up and got error 64 and 65 everytime i restarted. this is f&#8217;ed up&#8230;&#8230;.360 my azz&#8230;&#8230;WTF i got a 400 doller door stop.BOY AM I PISSED!!!!!!!!!!! Microshaft will be getting a call from me. </em></p></blockquote><br/> <p>problemi con la scheda grafica (che sembrerebbero essere attribuibili a un surriscaldamento  dei componenti)</p><br/> <blockquote><p><em>After about 10-15 minutes gameplay, I started getting the texture smearing and &#8220;sparklies&#8221; as was reported a while back on xbox-scene on one of the kiosk machines. Seemed like a video card or video ram overheating issue so I put a 80mm case fan I had already wired up to a power brick for 12v behind the 360&#8217;s exhaust fan blowing out. That fixed it mostly. After playing an hour or so it seemed ok, maybe one or two off pixels here and there. I don&#8217;t know that it couldn&#8217;t have developed into one of the other issues if I didn&#8217;t add the fan&#8230; and I don&#8217;t know if playing longer it will still blow up some other way. I&#8217;ll find out today, I took the day off work to play</em></p></blockquote><br/> <p>Dal canto suo, la Microsoft dichiara che i problemi sopracitati possono essere definiti casi &#8216;isolati&#8217; (<a href="http://next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&#38;task=view&#38;id=1720&#38;Itemid=2">Articolo 1</a> e <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051124/ap_on_hi_te/xbox_glitches;_ylt=AhOps_vl7ZnJ5nmaKrO_oFgh2.cA;_ylu=X3oDMTA3cjE0b2MwBHNlYwM3Mzg-">Articolo 2</a>) :</p><br/> <blockquote><p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s a few reports of consoles here and there not working properly,&#8221; said Molly O&#8217;Donnell, a spokeswoman for Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox division. &#8220;It&#8217;s what you would expect with a consumer electronics instrument of this complexity &#8230;. par for the course.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><br/> <p>Speriamo che per il lancio in Italia (fissato per il 2 Dicembre) i problemi vengano risolti&#8230; <img src='http://andrea.ariellab.org/wp-images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=')' /><br/></p>
