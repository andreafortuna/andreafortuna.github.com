![Nixie Concept](http://flynixie.com/images/nixie-copter.jpg)

Intel is [holding a competition](https://makeit.intel.com/finalists) to encourage new wearable technology ideas, and the [Nixie is one of the finalists](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/meet-the-finalists-of-intels-make-it-wearable-challenge).

It's still in development and the team captain [*Christoph Kohstall*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophkohstall/en) eventually wants you to be able to send the the Nixie flying with a gesture. 
It would recognize where you're standing, snap a picture, then return to the wrist.

From the [project website](http://flynixie.com/):

    Nixie is a tiny wearable camera on a wrist band. The wrist straps unfold to create a quadcopter that flies, takes photos or video, then comes back to you. 

Judging by this video, the project has to be kept under tight control! ;-)
