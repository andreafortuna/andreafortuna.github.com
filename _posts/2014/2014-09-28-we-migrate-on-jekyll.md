After a few years on blogspot, i decided to migrate my blog on a more modern platform.

Following the instructions in this excellent [post](http://blog.revathskumar.com/2013/08/blogger-to-jekyll.html) by *Revath S Kumar*, i imported the old posts on a brand new blog based on Jekyll, hosted on [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/).

There are still some details to be improved, but the new platform is exciting!
