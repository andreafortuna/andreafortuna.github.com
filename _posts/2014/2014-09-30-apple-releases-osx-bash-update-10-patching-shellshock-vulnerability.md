Apple has just released the Bash Update 1.0,  for OS X Mavericks, Mountain Lion, and Lion.
The patch fixes the [infamous "Shellshock" bug](http://oldsite.andreafortuna.org/2014/09/25/cve-2014-6271-shellshock-peggio-di/) in the Bash shell.

<!-- more -->

The update can be installed from *OS X Software Update*: for older OSX versions there are separate downloads for [Mavericks](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1769), [Mountain Lion](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1768)  and [Lion](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1767).

There is currently no patch for machines running the public or developer builds of OS X Yosemite.

After patch installation, you can test your system by running this command from Terminal:

    env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c 'echo hello'

If you're not vulnerable, you'll get this result:

    bash: warning: x: ignoring function definition attempt bash: error importing function definition for `x' hello

If you are still vulnerable, you'll get:

    vulnerable hello
