Today I propose a transcript of a very short and simple didactical piece written by *Joseph Küffner*.

>Joseph Küffner (1776 – 1856) was a German musician and composer who, among other achievements, contributed significantly to the guitar repertory, including chamber music.
He was a violinist with the Würzburg court orchestra, and was later, when Würzburg became part of Bavaria (1802), assigned to take charge of military music. At this point he became bandmaster with a Bavarian Army regiment.

([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_K%C3%BCffner){:target="_blank"})

The original music sheet is taken from the book "*Guitar Gradus*" of Ruggero Chiesa:

The original key is *G major*, and this transcript on ukulele was not necessary to make transpositions.
