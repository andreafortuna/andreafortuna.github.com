I resume the discussion related to the “why go running every morning before come to the office?”

I'm trying to achieve my personal record: 356 workouts in 365 days.

Since July 4, 2014 I train every day, braving the cold, wind, rain and snow, and this morning my app [Facebook Fitness Report](http://fitnessreport.andreafortuna.org/) notify me that from the start of 2015 i have made 100 workouts and i ran 1224 kilometers.

Small satisfactions!
