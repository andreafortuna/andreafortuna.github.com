*Irving Berlin* (May 11, 1888 – September 22, 1989) was a Jewish, Russian-born American composer and lyricist. 

Widely considered one of the greatest songwriters in American history, his music forms a great part of the Great American Songbook.

He wrote hundreds of songs, many becoming major hits, which made him "a legend" before he turned thirty. 

During his 60-year career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs, including the scores for 19 Broadway shows and 18 Hollywood films, with his songs nominated eight times for Academy Awards.

The piece

![original score](/ukulele/images/whitechristmas.jpg)

According to the Guinness World Records, the version sung by Bing Crosby is the best-selling single of all time, with estimated sales in excess of 100 million copies worldwide.

Other versions of the song, along with Bing Crosby's, have sold over 150 million copies.

The first public performance of the song was by Bing Crosby, on his NBC radio show The Kraft Music Hall on Christmas Day, 1941.

A copy of the recording from the radio program is owned by the estate of Bing Crosby and was loaned to CBS News Sunday Morning for their December 25, 2011, program.

My arrangement

The original was in *C*, but for a better usage of the ukulele tuning I preferred transpose in *G*.
