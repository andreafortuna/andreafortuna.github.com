The author

*John Towner Williams* (born February 8, 1932) is an American composer, conductor, and pianist.

I already talked about him in the [post about the "Imperial March"](http://oldsite.andreafortuna.org/ukulele/2015/12/12/imperial-march-on-ukulele/)

The piece

>"When I thought of a theme for Luke and his adventures, I composed a melody that reflected the brassy, bold, masculine, and noble qualities I saw in the character"

*John Williams on writing the "Main Title"*

<hr>

The *Main Title* or *Overture* is the most recognizable melody of the saga, the main theme is variously associated with *Luke Skywalker*, heroism, and adventure. 

It is heard over the opening crawl at the beginning of all the films and forms the basis of the end-title as well. 

The theme is most prominent in the first film in which strong brass treat it as a fanfare for Luke; throughout subsequent films, it is relied upon less frequently, though this restraint lends it a greater impact.

My arrangement
--

The original was in *G*, but for a better usage of the ukulele tuning I preferred transpose in *F*.

Here my (recorded-in-hurry-before-going-to-the-office) ukulele version:
