*Yes*, I'm the same guy you've seen running 40 minutes ago, I was going in the opposite direction.

*No*, they have not changed a lot compared to before, i'm only just  a little more sweated.

*Yes*, I'm running [barefoot](http://oldsite.andreafortuna.org/tags.html#Barefoot-ref): there is nothing strange, many people do it and it's good for health and mood.



Rather, about you: the table is the same, but the "*pizzetta*" (*)  you're biting not seem to be the same as before...
