A new adware software, called "eFast Browser" works by installing and running itself in place of *Google Chrome*.

<!-- more -->

eFast is based on Google's Chromium open-source software, so maintains the look and feel of Google Chrome at first glance, tricking users into believing that they are using the original *Chrome browser*.

[TheHackerNews says](http://thehackernews.com/2015/10/malware-chome.html){:target="_blank"}:

>The adware does all kinds of malicious activities that we have seen quite often over the years:
>
>- Generates pop-up, coupon, pop-under and other similar ads on your screen
>- Placing other advertisements into your web pages
>- Redirects you to malicious websites containing bogus contents
>- Tracking your movements on the web to help nefarious marketers send more crap your way to generating revenue
>
>Therefore, having eFast Browser installed on your machine may lead to serious privacy issues or even identity theft.

Furthermore, [malwarebytes explain](https://blog.malwarebytes.org/online-security/2015/10/efast-browser-hijacks-file-associations/){:target="_blank"} some methods used by this software to make sure the user use the new browser:

> eFast makes itself the default browser and takes over some file-associations. File-associations are settings that determine which program will run when files with a certain extension are opened.
