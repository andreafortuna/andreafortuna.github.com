Trick or treat? Instead of candy and sweets, I offer my own transcription on ukulele of the theme of the old and beloved TV series *The Addams Family*!

The Addams Family is an American television series based on the characters in *Charles Addams' New Yorker cartoons*. 

The theme for the TV series was written and arranged by *Vic Mizzy* (an American composer for television and movies whose best-known works are the themes to the 1960s television)). 

The song's arrangement was dominated by a harpsichord, with finger-snaps as percussive accompaniment.

This is the version that I used as a starting point for my transcript
