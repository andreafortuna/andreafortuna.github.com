Yesterday I attended to the "[Stramilano 2015](http://www.stramilano.it/)", a non-competitive race over the distance of 10 kilometers.

Great turnout of runners (about 55,000), favored by a beautiful sunny day.

The large presence of participants has distorted a bit my times: because of the large crowd, I had to walk in the first and the last kilometer, finishing the race in 58 minutes.

The most beautiful moment of the event was when, around the third kilometer, i surpass an engaged couple in obvious difficulty.
She, with the last remaining forces, says to her boyfriend:

>"Ma chi cazzo ce lo ha fatto fare?" ("_But who the fuck forced us to do so?_")

_(suggestions accepted for a better translation!)_

Applause!
