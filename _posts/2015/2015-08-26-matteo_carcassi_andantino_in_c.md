As usual, some informations about the author from ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Carcassi){:target="_blank"}):

>Carcassi was born in Florence, Italy, and first studied the piano, but learned guitar when still a child. He quickly gained a reputation as a virtuoso concert guitarist.
Carcassi wrote a method for guitar (op. 59), first published with Schott in Mainz, in 1836. It is still valuable, relevant and interesting. His most famous works are collected in his 25 Etudes op. 60. In these, he managed to blend technical skills and brilliant romantic music. This is the reason his music is still played by so many classical guitarists today.


As other guitar transcriptions on my site, the original music sheet was taken from the book "*Guitar Gradus*" of Ruggero Chiesa:
