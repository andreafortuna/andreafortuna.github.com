A famous and simple 32-measure piece in the key of G major: until 1970 it was attributed to *Johann Sebastian Bach* (BWV Anh 114), but it is now universally attributed to *Christian Petzold*.

Some informations about the piece extracted from ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuet_in_G_major_%28BWV_Anh_114%29){:target="_blank"}):

>The Minuet in G major is found in the 1725 Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach, where it appears with its companion piece, Minuet in G minor, as a pair to be performed da capo. The notebook in question, which belonged to Johann Sebastian Bach's second wife Anna Magdalena, is a compilation of music by various composers of the late 17th and early 18th century, including François Couperin, Georg Böhm, Johann Sebastian Bach himself and possibly some of his sons (e.g., Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach). Most of the entries in the 1725 notebook were made by Anna Magdalena herself, and a few were contributed by Johann Sebastian and various friends of the Bach family. Only a few composers are identified in the notebook. The Minuet in G major and its companion are two of the many anonymous works included. In the 1970s the Minuet in G major was identified as a piece from a harpsichord suite by Dresden organist Christian Petzold.

The [original](http://imslp.org/wiki/Minuet_in_G_major_(Pezold,_Christian)){:target="_blank"} was in *G major*, but for a better usage of the ukulele tuning I preferred transpose in *C major*.
