Android M and iOS 9 will introduce new features for battery saving: who will win?

The new release of Android, "M" includes some features for battery saving:

>**App Standby**: Google talked at Google I/O about its Doze feature that will put your phone into a deep sleep when you’re not using it to save on battery power. Android Police has flagged another feature called App Standby that will force individual apps into hibernation if you’re not using them, which should once again cut down on your phone’s background activity and thus improve its battery life. Interestingly, all background apps will automatically wake up from hibernation once you plug your phone into a charger so you won’t have to worry about missing any notifications when your phone is plugged in.

*A very similar approach to that used by [Greenify](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.greenify){:target="_blank"}, but at a level more close to the system.*


And yesterday Apple have presented the new iOS 9 with (finally) a new functionality to extend battery life:

>**Even longer battery life.** Across the entire operating system, apps and key technologies have been made more efficient to trim battery usage wherever possible — so you get more battery life for the things you do every day. Thanks to ambient light and proximity sensors, your iPhone knows if it’s facedown on the table and prevents the screen from turning on, even when you receive a notification. And the new Low Power mode lets you extend your battery life even further.

*As usual, Apple does not provide too many details on the solution.*

Perhaps our beloved devices will survive an entire day on a single charge? I know I'm a dreamer!
