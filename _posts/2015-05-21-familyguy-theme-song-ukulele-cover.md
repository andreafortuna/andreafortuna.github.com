New transcription! 
This time I dedicate myself to the opening theme of "Family Guy," the funny animated series created by Seth MacFarlane.

The theme was written by [Walter Murphy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Murphy), who also wrote the music for "[American Dad!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dad!)" and "[The Cleveland Show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cleveland_Show)".

This is my personal transcription for ukulele:

Piece short and simple to perform, suitable also for beginners. 

In the score there are my suggestions as regards the fingering for both hands.
