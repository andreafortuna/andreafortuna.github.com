*Franz Xaver Gruber*, was an Austrian primary school teacher and church organist in the village of Arnsdorf.

Born on November 25, 1787 in the village of *Hochburg*, Gruber worked as a weaver until the age of 18, then trained to become a schoolteacher.

He completed his music education studying with the church organist of *Burghausen*, Georg Hartdobler. 

In 1807 became schoolteacher in *Arnsdorf*.

![original score](/ukulele/images/silentnight.jpg)

"Silent Night" (in German: *Stille Nacht*) is a popular Christmas carol, composed in 1818 by Gruber to lyrics by *Joseph Mohr* in the small town of Oberndorf bei Salzburg, Austria. 
The original manuscript has been lost. However, a manuscript was discovered in 1995 in Mohr's handwriting and dated by researchers at ca. 1820. 

It shows that Mohr wrote the words in 1816 when he was assigned to a pilgrim church in Mariapfarr, Austria, and shows that the music was composed by Gruber in 1818.

The version of the melody that is generally used today is a slow, meditative lullaby, differing slightly from Gruber's original, which was a sprightly, dance-like tune in 6/8 time. 

It was declared an intangible cultural heritage by *UNESCO* in 2011 and the lyrics and melody are in the *public domain*.

My arrangement

The original was in *A*, but for a better usage of the ukulele tuning I preferred transpose in *C*.

Here my ukulele version:
