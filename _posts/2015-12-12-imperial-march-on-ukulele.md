The author
--
*John Towner Williams* (born February 8, 1932) is an American composer, conductor, and pianist.
In a career spanning over six decades, Williams has composed some of the most popular and recognizable film scores in cinematic history, including the Star Wars series.


The piece

![original score](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/af/Star_Wars_The_March_of_the_Empire.png)

*The Imperial March* is sometimes referred to simply as *Darth Vader's Theme*. 
In the movies (except for the original Star Wars), the march is often played when Darth Vader appears. 
It is also played during Palpatine's arrival on the Death Star in Return of the Jedi, though it does segue into the Emperor's own theme as he appears.

My arrangement
--

The original was in *G minor*, but for a better usage of the ukulele tuning I preferred transpose in *A minor*.

Here my ukulele version:
