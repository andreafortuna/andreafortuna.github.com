Recently i have migrated my [blog on Jekyll](http://www.andreafortuna.org/blogging/2014/09/28/we-migrate-on-jekyll/), and i started to write all my posts in a very simple english using markdown.
<!-- more -->
Using blogspot i can save posts as draft on my personal laptop and complete editing on any office workstation, but with jekill i must configure the GIT environment everytime i using a new PC.

A possible solution could be use [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com), but this online service lacks markdown support. However, using [Marxi.co](http://marxi.co) we can fill this gap. 

*Marxi.co* is an online markdown editor with Evernote synchronization feature: simple, fast and accessible from every workstation.
