Playing an instrument is like playing a sport.

![Daily Workout](/ukulele/images/DailyWorkout.jpeg)
<!-- more -->

Muscles and joints need to be trained and kept moving.

So, Every day, in addition to keep [my legs in moving](/running/) , I try to keep my hands in training, regardless of the time I can dedicate to the study of the repertoire.

I try to carve out a small window of free time dedicated to a series of exercises designed primarily to train the muscles of the hands and improve coordination.

First step: WarmUp!
--

Muscle warming is important, even in musical instrument practice. 
So, before starting every exercise, i make a brief series of warming exercises focused on muscular awakening and coordination improvement.

In this exercise, is very important to follow the instructions regarding the fingering: its purpose is just what to make work equally all fingers of both hands.

Second step: Chromatic exercise!
--

Simple chromatic pattern, and 2 variations with string skipping:

Third step: Spiders!
--

Now that we have warmed the fingers, we execute two short sequences focused to develop coordination between the two hands, the famous 'spiders' ([V.1](http://www.andreafortuna.org/ukulele/2015/05/19/ukulele-spider-pattern/) and [V.2](http://www.andreafortuna.org/ukulele/2015/06/23/ukulele-spider-exercise-v2/))

Final step: Scales!

At this point, a creative approach: a nice refresher of [diatonic scales (major and minor)](http://www.andreafortuna.org/ukulele/2015/12/10/major-minor-scales-patterns/) 

![Diatonic scales](/ukulele/images/diatonic_scales_workout.png)

and [pentatonic](http://www.andreafortuna.org/ukulele/2016/01/18/pentatonic-scales-patterns/)

concludes the daily training.


And now we begin to study the [repertoire](http://www.andreafortuna.org/ukulele/tabs.html)!
