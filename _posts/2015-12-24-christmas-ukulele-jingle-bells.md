*James Lord Pierpont* (April 25, 1822 - August 5, 1893) was a New England born songwriter, arranger, organist, and composer.

He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and died in Winter Haven, Florida.

His composition "Jingle Bells" has become synonymous with the Christmas holiday and is one of the most performed and most recognizable songs in the world.

The piece

![original score](/ukulele/images/jinglebells.jpg)

<br>"Jingle Bells" is one of the best-known and commonly sung American wintertime songs in the world. 

It was published under the title *"One Horse Open Sleigh"* in the autumn of 1857. 

Even though it is now associated with the Christmas and holiday season, it was actually originally written for American Thanksgiving.

It has been claimed that it was originally written to be sung by a Sunday school choir; however, historians dispute this, stating that it was much too "racy" to be sung by a children's church choir in the days it was written.

My arrangement

The original was in *G*, but for a better usage of the ukulele tuning I preferred transpose in *F*.

Here my ukulele version:
