<p>Sono gli stessi sviluppatori del famoso sito di <em>Social Bookmarking</em> a dare la <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html">notizia</a>:</p><p> <em>'We're proud to announce that del.icio.us has joined the Yahoo! family. Together we'll continue to improve how people discover, remember and share on the Internet, with a big emphasis on the power of community. We're excited to be working with the Yahoo! Search team - they definitely get social systems and their potential to change the web. (We're also excited to be joining our fraternal twin Flickr!)'"  </em></p><a target="_blank" href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html"></a>
