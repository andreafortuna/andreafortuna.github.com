Never ask a group of classical guitarists if you can play even without the nails of the right hand!

You risk being insulted brutally....and absolutely do not mention TÃ¡rrega!

Seriously, I came across this video where [Rob MacKillop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOWb_t8Pmq3G9cM_IZO4BMw){:target="_blank"} explains his technique developed without using the nails of his right hand, inspired by Fernando Sor technique.

<hr/>

Often, when you play other instruments besides the guitar (such as *piano*, *bass*, *lute* or [ukulele](/ukulele/)) the right hand nails can be an obstacle or more susceptible to breakage, and it must be found a compromise solution.

It could be an interesting inspiration for a discussion on this topic.
