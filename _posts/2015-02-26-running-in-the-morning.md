Some colleagues asked me: "Why go running every morning before come to the office?".

<!-- more -->

The explanation is very simple, in my case:

1. I don't like make workouts in the afternoon: after the office work i like to devote some time to more relaxing activities (reading, cooking, listen music, watching movies and TV Series)

2. Face the day with a "endorphin overdose" makes everything more easy!

3. After a workout done at the sunrise (6:30AM), just woke up and half asleep (in Rome they say  *"con gli occhi abbottonati"* - *"with buttoned eyes"* ) and (in winter) with a temperature close to zero, all things to do in the day suddenly seem trivial!

4. Last but not least: do your workout before the rest of the world is awake saves marriages and cohabitations, especially with partners who do not like running!
