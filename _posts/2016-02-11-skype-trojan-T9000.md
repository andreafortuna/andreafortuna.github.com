A new sophisticated malware which can take recordings and screenshots of Skype activity, avoiding detection by security software, has been discovered by [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/).

*T9000* represents a new variant of the *T5000* malware family: it works to identify a total of 24 potential security products running on a system and then alters its installation procedure in order to avoid the relevant cyber defences.

The primary functionality of this malware is to collect information about the targeted victim which is does by compromising Skype video calling software. 

After the malware has hooked into Skype, it records video calls, audio calls, and chat messages, then it stores them in a directory specially created by the trojan called *Intel*, which the attackers can access remotely.

A system gets infected with *T9000* when the user inadvertently opens an *RTF* file compromised with exploits for both [CVE-2012-1856](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1856) (Vulnerability in Windows Common Controls in *MSCOMCTL.OCX*) and [CVE-2015-1641](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1641) (Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability) vulnerabilities. 

When this module is downloaded and executed, the user will receive the message *explorer.exe wants to use Skype*, like this screenshot:

Any system that does not have Microsoft updates [MS12-060](https://technet.microsoft.com/it-it/library/security/ms12-060.aspx) and [MS15-033](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms15-033.aspx) is impacted.
