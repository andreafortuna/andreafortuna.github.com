It's an idea of an italian *startupper*, [Manuel Zanella](http://www.manuelzanella.it/): a *SIM* that works (in roaming) with all carriers and that permits only WhatsApp traffic.

<!-- more -->

The SIM permits only text traffic on whatsapp: no call, no SMS, no internet surfing. 

To send multimedia contents through whatsapp you need to [buy credits](http://www.whatsim.com/en/rates).

You can buy the SIM directly [from the site](http://www.whatsim.com/en/buy-now), at a cost of ***EUR 5***

Here the press release: [http://www.whatsim.com/en/press/press-release-en](http://www.whatsim.com/en/press/press-release-en)

It will be a winning idea or will be a flop?
