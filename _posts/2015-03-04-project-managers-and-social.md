In recent days I have attended a course taught by the excellent [Piero Tagliapietra](http://www.piero.tagliapietra.net/) dedicated to "*Strategic and Tactical Approaches to the Social Media*".

Course very interesting (and very  good teacher): we have faced fascinating topics, such as strategy, security, monitoring, the use of Agile methodology (and Scrum) applied to social media, and an interesting roundup of useful online tools.

However the most important (_and sad_) teaching was provided by my own colleagues and classmates:

It's hard to believe how experienced *Project Managers* who work in *IT* from years are afraid of *Social Media* and the information that they can share, and at the same time, their little knowledge about the problems related to the management of security and privacy. 

As usual, you are afraid of what you do not know.
