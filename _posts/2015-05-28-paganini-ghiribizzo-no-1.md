I have realized that many of the Paganini's "43 Ghiribizzi" (I have already talked about in [this post](http://www.andreafortuna.org/ukulele/2015/05/25/paganini-ghiribizzo-no-4/)) are well placed to be transcribed for ukulele.

Today I made then the transcription of "Ghiribizzo No. 1", a short piece originally in A Major, transposed to C Major for a better usage of the open strings (like my [transcription of "Ghiribizzo No. 4"](http://www.andreafortuna.org/ukulele/2015/05/25/paganini-ghiribizzo-no-4/)).

The score contains also my suggestions regarding the fingering for both hands.
