Playing an instrument is like playing a sport.

![Daily Workout](/ukulele/images/daily_workout.png)

Muscles and joints need to be trained and kept moving.


Every day, then, in addition to keep my legs in moving , I try to keep my hands in training, regardless of the time I can dedicate to the study of the repertoire.

So I try to carve out a small window of free time to dedicate to a series of exercises designed primarily to train the muscles of the hands and improve coordination.
