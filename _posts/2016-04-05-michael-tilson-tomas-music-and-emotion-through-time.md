>But every musician strikes a different balance between *faith and reason*, *instinct and intelligence*. And every musical era had different priorities of these things, different things to pass on, different *'whats'* and *'hows'*. So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big 'what' was to praise God. And by the **1400s**, music was being written that tried to mirror God's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky. The 'how' was a style called **polyphony**, music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in Ptolemy's geocentric universe. This was truly the music of the spheres.
