Some informations about the author (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinando_Carulli){:target="_blank"}):

>Ferdinando Maria Meinrado Francesco Pascale Rosario Carulli (Naples, 9 February 1770 – Paris, 17 February 1841) was an Italian composer for classical guitar and the author of the influential Méthode complète pour guitare ou lyre, op. 27 (1810), which contains music still used by student guitarists today. He wrote a variety of works for classical guitar, including numerous solo and chamber works and several concertos. He was an extremely prolific writer, composing over 400 works for the instrument.

The original music sheet is taken from the book "*Guitar Gradus*" of Ruggero Chiesa:

The original key is *G major*, and this transcript on ukulele was not necessary to make transpositions.
