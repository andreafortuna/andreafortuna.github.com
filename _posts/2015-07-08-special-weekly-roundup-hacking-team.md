It is unknown how or by whom, but in theory it is possible it was hacked with help of its own products. Ironically, Hacking Team sells systems that allow its customers to hack. This incident underlines the risk of a boomerang effect as a result of allowing the unregulated sales of intrusion and surveillance technologies. Additionally, it underlines the need for companies to take effective action to ensure protection of data and systems.

ATMFD.dll is one of the font drivers. While the module processes the font data, there exists a buffer underflow, which is caused by a signed number extending.
