The paternity of the song is controversial: for more information you can read this (long)  [thread](http://www.classicalguitardelcamp.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=10646){:target="_blank"} (dated 2006) on www.classicalguitardelcamp.com.


The most famous version of Romance is that recorded by Yepes for the soundtrack of the film "Jeux Interdits" of 1952: probably the music is not completely composed by Yepes, but his contribution was fundamental to the success of this melody, which has become a synonymous of the classical guitar in the world.

Here a video of Yepes performing the song with his [Ten-String Guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-string_classical_guitar_of_Yepes){:target="_blank"}:

This is my arrangement for Ukulele, with standard High-G tuning.

I've transcribed the song on ukulele trying to keep the fingering the most possible close to the original guitar parts, so i've transposed the song a fifth lower, from Em to Am.
