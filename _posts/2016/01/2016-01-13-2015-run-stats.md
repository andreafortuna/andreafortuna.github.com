Some days ago, i've read [this](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102579344275191&set=a.529237706231.2034669.4){:target="_blank"} post from *Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page*:

>I have a physical challenge for 2016 as well.
I'm going to run 365 miles and I'd love for as many people in this community to join me as possible.

To clarify: my *run streak* [started in July of 2014 and is still ongoing](http://oldsite.andreafortuna.org/running/2015/07/04/369-workouts-in-365-days/), but i was curious to find out how many kilometers I have run during 2015.

So i aggregate all the data registered with tracking apps that i usually use ([RunKeeper](https://runkeeper.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Runtastic](https://www.runtastic.com/){:target="_blank"} and [SportsTracker](http://www.sports-tracker.com/){:target="_blank"}) and I got this report:

- Activities: *368*  (yes, sometimes i have made 2 workouts in a day)
- Total distance: *4710 kilometers*
- Average pace: *6:57/Km* (Yes, I'm a *TurtleRunner*!)

It's official: *in 2015 my car has traveled less kilometers than me*!
