A bit of theory and some simple patterns to easily play major and minor scales on ukulele.

A pentatonic scale is a musical scale with five notes per octave, very common in many musical cultures all over the world. 

>Pentatonics scales are characterized not only by their lack of semitone intervals, but also by the fact that each of the five notes can be a final note.
Therefore it "is inappropriate to distinguish between a major and minor pentatonic scale, but it is evident that into the pentatonic scale there are two tonal modes, major and minor".

(from [Wikipedia](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_pentatonica){:target="_blank"})

The major pentatonic scale may be thought of as an *incomplete major scale*.

However, the pentatonic scale has a unique character and is complete in terms of tonality. 

Can be created taking five consecutive pitches from the circle of fifths: for example, starting on C, these are C, G, D, A, and E.

This is a simple pattern that can be easily played on all the fretboard:

Minor pentatonic scale

*Minor* pentatonic scales are built on a natural minor scale without the second and the sixth grade.
For example, the "minor" pentatonic of A has the same notes of the "major" pentatonic of C, simply played from A, and has a minor third interval from the start.

The pattern on ukulele is:

Adding to this scale the fourth degree increased (the blue note) you get the *blues scale*:
