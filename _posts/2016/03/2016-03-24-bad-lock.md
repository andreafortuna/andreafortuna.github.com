>I think that **Badlock** is likely one of the worst examples of marketing and hype for a vulnerability that we've seen to date.

>Even **Heartbleed** didn't have a teaser notification three weeks out. To make matters worse, the company that owns the domain promoting the vulnerability is glad for the marketing opportunity it's providing.

>Granted, there are valid reasons for naming vulnerabilities, as it brings attention to an issue that can be shared with a wider audience â€“ at least it's better than using CVE or MS patch IDs.

>*Likewise, giving administrators a heads-up on something is okay too, but three weeks?*

>If there is a need to bring attention to Badlock, what's the point of a teaser? Why couldn't the branding and website promotion wait until the patch was released?

>**Again it's sales.**
