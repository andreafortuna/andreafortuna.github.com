Never ask a group of classical guitarists if you can play even without the nails of the right hand!

You risk being insulted brutally....and absolutely do not mention Tárrega!

Seriously, I came across this video where [Rob MacKillop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOWb_t8Pmq3G9cM_IZO4BMw){:target="_blank"} explains his technique developed without using the nails of his right hand, inspired by Fernando Sor technique.

<hr/>

Often, when you play other instruments besides the guitar (such as *piano*, *bass*, *lute* or [ukulele](/ukulele/)) the right hand nails can be an obstacle or more susceptible to breakage, and it must be found a compromise solution.

It could be an interesting inspiration for a discussion on this topic, like this [interesting article](http://www.adamrafferty.com/2012/03/19/guitar-right-hand-technique-nails-vs-flesh/){:target="_blank"} by *Adam Rafferty*:

- You are producing a FAT sound that originates from a deeper place than just the surface of the string.
- The front of your note should be like a "plump grapefruit" – not a cat claw!
- You "pop" the string into motion and love the sound you make playing a single note on your high E string.
- If you don’t like your sound, seek to fix it at the finger and string origin point – not the amplifier or eq knob.
- Don’t worry about speed.  That’s a lower priority than tone.
- Listen to all great musicians on other instruments and go for a strength and center in your tone like theirs.
- Commit to your choice whatever it is and practice.  It can take years to develop technique, so be patient.
- Listen attentively to the sound you are making, all the time.
