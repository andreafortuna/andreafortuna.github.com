In 1829 Niccolò Paganini wrote the *"Variations for violin and orchestra op. 10"* based on the venetian folk song *'O mamma, mamma cara'*.

<!-- more -->

The composition is based on a simple theme of a folk song, followed by a series of variations, all in the same key, which constitute a kind of synthesis of all the more difficult aspects of violin technique. 

After Paganini, many other composers wrote variations on this theme song.

My arrangement
--

I used as a starting point the score for violin with piano accompaniment (from [IMSLP](http://imslp.org/wiki/Il_carnevale_di_Venezia,_Op.10_(Paganini,_Niccol%C3%B2)){:target="_blank"}), and I tried to 'mixing' the theme of the violin:

with the arpeggio played by the piano:

The result is pretty simple and easy to perform:

Some tips
--
In the transcript I inserted a few tips about the right hand:
I recommend to using your thumb to play the notes on the downbeat of the accompanying voice, for having a *rhythmic point of reference* during the execution, and for emphasize the rhythmic structure of the musical phrasing.
