In 1829 Nicolò Paganini wrote the "Variations for violin and orchestra op. 10" based on Venetian folk song 'O mamma, mamma cara'.

<!-- more -->

The composition is based on a simple theme of folk song, followed by a series of variations, all in the same key, which constitute a kind of synthesis of all the more difficult aspects of violin technique. 

After Paganini, many other composers wrote variations on this theme song.
