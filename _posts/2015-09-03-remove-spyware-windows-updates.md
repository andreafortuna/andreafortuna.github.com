Windows 10 terms and conditions clearly say "we will access, disclose and preserve personal data."

Many Windows users are unhappy with Microsoft’s choice to spy on its users: privacy conscious users opted to not to update to Windows 10 and use an older version of Windows (7/8/8.1).

But two recent windows updates (KB3075249 and KB3080149) grants to old Windows versions a capability to capture and send your data to microsoft’s servers.

With a more accurate search, you can find other updates that Microsoft justifies as *"telemetry and customer experience improvements"*:
