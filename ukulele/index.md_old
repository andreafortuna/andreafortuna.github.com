As a child I started studying music and classical guitar, then i dedicated myself also to other musical genres.

Recently, I had a "love at first sight" for the ukulele: a musical instrument that many call a "little guitar", but with a soul and a technique radically different from his cousin with 6 strings.

In this section I am going to publish my thoughts, my exercises and my transcriptions.
