The world’s first WhatsApp Sim that makes you chat with WhatsApp absolutely free of charge and with no limits. Even without Wi-Fi connection. WhatSim connects WhatsApp in about 150 countries with more than 400 operators. WhatSim lets you stay in touch with friends, family or co-workers and tell everyone where you are while traveling. The inventor of this innovative Sim card is Manuel Zanella, who also happens to be the founder of Zeromobile and the first mover of wearable technology with his i’m Watch, the world’s first smartwatch. A special WhatSim version inspired by Pope Francis and designed specifically for countries in the Global South is now available. #WhatSim #WhatsAppSim Milan (Italy) – Los Angeles (California), January 21, 2015 – WhatSim is here! It is the first WhatsApp Sim that lets you chat absolutely free of charge and without any limits using WhatsApp, the world’s most popular messaging system with about 700 million active users a month. Anywhere in the world. WhatSim connects to more than 400 operators in about 150 countries. Anywhere in the world it connects to the provider with the best coverage and signal right where you are. If you change your position, it automatically searches for a new provider. If a better one is available, it connects by itself without you even noticing it. Thanks to WhatSim and its worldwide data connection, you can finally chat with WhatsApp whenever and wherever you want without any limits. What until recently was only a dream for WhatsApp users is now a reality thanks to WhatSim. Last year, E-Plus launched a Sim in Germany that allows you to chat even without credit, but no one had thought yet of a worldwide Sim. The idea came to an Italian entrepreneur, Manuel Zanella (38 years old), engineer, founder and CEO of Zeromobile – Italy’s first Global Mobile Operator for low-cost roaming (founded in 2007 with the support and participation of Ennio Doris, founder and president of Mediolanum Group) that makes you save up to 85% on the cost of incoming and outgoing calls, text messages and mobile Internet and receive calls absolutely free in over 140 countries (www.zeromobile.it). Manuel Zanella is also famous for being in 2011 the “first mover” in the wearable technology industry with i’m Watch, the world’s first smartwatch, designed and manufactured by i’m Spa, a company founded with the support of Ennio Doris. The CEO of Zeromobile explained, “After i’m Watch, I gave myself a six-month deadline to come up with a new project. So here I am today to introduce WhatSim.” WhatSim is a stroke of genius. That comes from far away… “In 2003 I went on my honeymoon to Kenya. I needed to find a cheap way of calling without international roaming and its outrageous costs so I created Zeromobile,” said Manuel Zanella. “The world has changed once again so I’ve launched WhatSim. In a world where more and more people are traveling, the need to stay in touch with others in a simple and fast way has become essential. Once we would call, then we started sending text messages. Now these are days of WhatsApp. Since 90% of my contacts have WhatsApp, I decided to create a Sim card dedicated specifically to WhatsApp.” Just a few weeks ago the CEO of WhatsApp issued a statement listing his company’s achievements: 700 million active users and 30 billion messages exchanged every day. Zanella then went on to comment, “WhatsApp is the future of mobile communications. Its only “limit” is the data connection especially when you are traveling because the roaming charges are expensive and you can’t always find Wi-Fi everywhere and it is not always free. As someone who appreciates and uses WhatsApp, I tried to figure out how to get around this problem. That’s why WhatSim is an extraordinary opportunity for WhatsApp.” Everyone now uses WhatsApp, even when traveling. But you need a data or Wi-Fi connection to chat for free. The most common problem is that the roaming data connection is usually expensive and Wi-Fi is not available everywhere and often it is not even free. There’s a popular myth that needs debunking: There is no such thing as free Wi-Fi everywhere. WhatSim allows you to chat with WhatsApp whenever you want. There is no other solution for real-time chatting. Otherwise you need to wait for the first free Wi-Fi connection you find on the road, at the hotel, in a restaurant or who knows where. All SIMs make you chat. But only WhatSim lets you chat for free, without limits, wherever you are! WhatSim costs just €10 and you can chat for free all over the world for a year. To continue chatting free and with no limits for a year, you will always pay €10. Of course only if you choose to use it. WhatSim has neither fixed costs nor monthly payments and it never expires. WhatSim lets you exchange not only words, but also multimedia messages. To enable sharing photos, videos, voice messages or your location and contacts (which are notified free even without recharging), just buy a credit package starting from a minimum charge of €5. As Manuel Zanella explained, “The solution we have developed is simple and intuitive. With €5 you get 1000 credits that you can use, for instance, to exchange 50 photos or 10 videos in many countries around the world. There are no limits to sharing your position and contacts. This way we guarantee the utmost transparency. Buying a recharge is quick and easy: just go to our website even from your smartphone and soon even from a dedicated app.” And that’s not all. WhatsApp has no ads, but it has a subscription fee starting from the second year. WhatSim will refund it. When you renew your WhatSim, you will find the amount of the WhatsApp subscription fee as credit that you can use to share multimedia messages. (For more information: www.whatsim.com). Rumors say that WhatsApp will soon be introducing even voice calls. Another extraordinary opportunity for WhatSim. WhatsApp will then be able to replace operators for voice calls and messaging, but WhatsApp needs a data connection. That’s what WhatSim is for: it is the only Sim that connects to all operators (through roaming agreements) ensuring maximum coverage and service reliability. As Zanella stressed, “WhatSim could have an enormous potential in developing countries where coverage by single operators is not always optimal and where the base cost for communicating with WhatsApp using a conventional Sim could actually be more expensive in some cases. WhatSim’s great innovation is its very low flat rate for an entire year all over the world.” According to the 2014 Report of the ITU (International Telecommunication Union) 4.4 billion people are not connected yet to the Internet. And 90% of them are living in developing countries, two thirds of which are in the Third World. “I thought about all these facts,” said the CEO of Zeromobile. “And I thought about what Pope Francis said in his message on the occasion of the 2014 World Day of Social Communications. ‘Good communication helps us to grow closer… Those who communicate, in effect, become neighbors,’ said the Pope: to me, like millions of other people, he is a great model for the feeling of hope he inspires and for his revolutionary ability to reach people. That’s where I got the idea of creating a special version of WhatSim that is inspired by Pope Francis and designed for those countries of the world that the UN calls the Global South.” In some of these countries, buying a WhatSim will cost €5 instead of €10. The goal is to reach as many countries of the Global South as possible with this opportunity. Because sometimes words can make life better. Or even save it… “Mark Zuckerberg, the genius who created Facebook and took over WhatsApp in February 2014, dreams of making the Internet available all over the world through the Internet.org project. Until that day comes,” concludes Manuel Zanella , “I thought of taking the WhatSim all over the world, even where WhatsApp is still not available because there is no Internet. Because WhatSim is not for the few. WhatSim is for everyone.” WhatSim can be purchased on-line at www.whatsim.com. It is delivered all over the world with local shipping costs thanks to a special agreement with an international logistics partner. WhatSim will be distributed through a network of local distributors in over 100 countries. WhatSim is based in Milan and Los Angeles.
