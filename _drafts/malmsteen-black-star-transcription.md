The Album
--
Rising Force is the first studio album of Yngwie Malmsteen, released on 5 March 1984.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_Force){:target="_blank"} :

>**Steve Huey** at *AllMusic* gave **Rising Force** four stars out of five, calling it "a revelation upon its release" and "The true inauguration of the age of the guitar shredder." He praised Malmsteen's technique and "blinding virtuosity", as well as highlighting his "obsessions with Bach, Beethoven, and Paganini".

>**"Black Star"** and **"Far Beyond the Sun"** have endured as two of Malmsteen's most popular songs, as well as being staples of his live setlist. In a 2008 Guitar World interview, Malmsteen said of the two songs: "I'll probably play 'Far Beyond the Sun' and 'Black Star' until the day I die."

The famous intro
--

Malmsteen plays "Black Star" intro in fingerstyle, on nylon strings. Few and simple notes, but very effective.
