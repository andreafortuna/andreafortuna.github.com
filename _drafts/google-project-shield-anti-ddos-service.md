<hr/>

From [Service Website](https://projectshield.withgoogle.com/public/){:target="_blank"}:

>Project Shield welcomes applications from websites serving news. Human rights and or elections monitoring content are also welcome to apply. We do not provide service to other types of content, including gaming, businesses, or individual blogs. 

All data collected are used only "for DDoS mitigation and caching and to improve the Project Shield service".

Not for all!

You will need a *Google account* to use the service, but the service is not for all  websites:

>Project Shield welcomes applications from websites serving news. Human rights and or elections monitoring content are also welcome to apply. 

>We do not provide service to other types of content, including gaming, businesses, or individual blogs.
