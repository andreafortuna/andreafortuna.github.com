Seriously, it's really required? :-)

Anyway, *Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart* (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791), baptised as *Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart*, was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era. 

Born in *Salzburg*, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. 

Already competent on *keyboard* and *violin*, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty.

From [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._11_(Mozart)#Movement_Three_-_Rondo_Alla_Turca_.28Turkish_March.29.){:target="_blank"}:


Mozart himself titled the rondò [**Alla Turca**](http://imslp.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No.11_in_A_major,_K.331/300i_(Mozart,_Wolfgang_Amadeus)){:target="_blank"}.

It imitates the sound of *Turkish Janissary bands*, the music of which was much in vogue at that time.

In Mozart's time, the last movement was sometimes performed on pianos built with a [*Janizary pedal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_pedals#Janissary_or_Janizary_pedals){:target="_blank"}, allowing it to be embellished with extra percussion effects.

The form of the rondo is *A-B-C-D-E-C-A-B-C-coda*, with each section (except the coda) being repeated twice.

- *Section A* - This section, in *A minor*, consists of a rising sixteenth note melody followed by a falling eighth note melody over a staccato eighth note accompaniment. It is eight measures long.

- *Section B* - This section introduces new material in a melody in thirds and eighth notes before varying the **A** section with a crescendo before falling back to piano.

- *Section C* - A forte march in octaves over an arpeggiated chord accompaniment. The key changes to *A major*.

- *Section D* - A piano continuous sixteenth note melody over a broken chord accompaniment.

- *Section E* - A forte scale-like theme followed by a modification of section **D**.

- *Coda* - A forte theme consisting mostly of chords (arpeggiated and not) and octaves. There is a brief piano restatement of the theme in the middle of the coda. The movement ends with alternating *A* and *C-sharp* octaves followed by two *A* major chords.
