*Édith Piaf* (19 December 1915 – 10 October 1963) was a French cabaret singer, songwriter and actress who became widely regarded as France's national chanteuse, as well as being one of France's greatest international stars.

Her music was often autobiographical with her singing reflecting her life, with her specialty being of chanson and torch ballads, particularly of love, loss and sorrow. 

Among her well known songs are *La Vie en rose* (1946), *Non, je ne regrette rien* (1960), *Hymne à l'amour* (1949), *Milord* (1959), *La Foule* (1957), *L'Accordéoniste* (1955), and *Padam ... Padam ...* (1951).

Since her premature death in 1963 and with the aid of several biographies and films including 2007's *Academy Award* winning "*La Vie en rose*" Piaf has cultivated a legacy as one of the greatest performers of the 20th century where her voice and music continues to be celebrated globally.

The Piece
--
The lyrics and melody of the song were written by *Édith Piaf* herself, but the melody was said officially to have been composed and registered by *Louis Guglielmi* only, since at the time, due to the stringent registration requirements of the "Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique", Piaf did not have the necessary qualifications to be able to copyright her work with it.

My transcription
--
It is a transcription of medium/low difficulty level, where the only point of attention may be constituted by the need to maintain the sound clean in the high sections of the fretboard.
