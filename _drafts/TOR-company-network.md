**TOR** is an important tool. 

It has its benefits and it might sound like the perfect way for everyday people to cover their tracks, but using this tool in a corporate network can open up organizations to security risks, liability and potential litigation. 

Detecting and blocking Tor in a corporate network is not an easy thing. 

Sysadmins should consider the deployment of more than one solution to enhance the chance of preventing the use of **Tor** in their network.

What is TOR?
--

Tor is a software that allows users to browse the Web anonymously. 

Tor stands for "The Onion Router" and it is called so because it uses the "Onion routing protocol" to hide information about user activity, location and usage from anyone that conducts network surveillance or traffic analysis. 

It's steadily used by journalists, political dissidents and criminals to keep their communications private.

The development of the "onion routing protocol" was sponsored by the **U.S. Naval Research Laboratory** in the 1990s, and Tor was developed by the Navy and independent researchers in 2002. 

Currently the protocol is still being worked on and supported under the **[Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org)**, a nonprofit organization.


How it works?
--

When you connect to Tor, your computer becomes a node and can be used by any other Tor users to relay their traffic. 

The Tor network hides your identity by moving your traffic (that was encrypted) across different computers (the nodes) located all across the world. 

Instead of taking a direct route from source to destination, the data packet sent on the Tor network takes a random pathway through several servers: no one will ever know the complete path that a data packet has taken (in effect no one at any single node can tell where the data originally came from and where is the final destination).

It can be a risk?

While it is true that Tor can be used with the legitimate goal of anonymity on the internet, it can represent a gigantic problem for a company: bypassing network security, connecting to criminal sites on the ‘darknet’ or ‘dark web’ (websites only accessible from within an anonymized network), involving the organization in criminal activities, exposing the corporate network to malware infections, etc.
