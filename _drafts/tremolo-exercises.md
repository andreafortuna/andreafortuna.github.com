The tremolo is a beautiful techniques of the classical guitar: it gives the impression of flow of notes, a continuous thread of sound. 

Basically it's made playing a bass note with the thumb followed by three repeated higher notes, traditionally plucked with the ring (a), middle (m), and index (i) fingers. play the higher notes. 

When played rapidly, this technique creates the illusion of a sustained melodic line with a bass accompaniment. 


In his article *How to Write For the Guitar*, **Julian Bream** describes the tremolo as a 

>delightful technique on the guitar... This effect should be used very sparingly, and I would advise composers to limit their use of it to extended compositions such as a sonata, suite, or concerto, where it can effectively be used to give textural variety, when all the other 'stops' have been pulled!"

and

>This technique is said to have developed through the desire to emulate the sustained, singing tone of a violin on an instrument with limited sustain.  It is an advanced technique that not all performers can master.

 



Keep the thumb quiet

Although a few exceptions can be found, in most tremolo passages in the repertoire, the fingers carry the melody and the thumb plays the accompaniment. Therefore, when practicing any of the tremolo exercises in this article, it is important to train the thumb to play quietly. As the speed of an exercise is increased, the thumb naturally will tend to play louder. It becomes more difficult to curb this tendency at fast speeds. For this reason, when practicing these exercises at the recommended slow starting speeds, the thumb should play pianissimo or pianississimo. Then, as you reach tremolo speeds of MM=144+ the balance between thumb and fingers will be correct. Proper balance of volume between the thumb and fingers is an essential element of a good tremolo.
