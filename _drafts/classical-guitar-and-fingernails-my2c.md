>It should be noted that the finger pad is useful only for stopping the string, **which should definitely get in touch with the fingernail from the first moment**. 
>For this purpose the fingernail must be left grow for its entire length so as to form the contact edge indicated by the arrow. 
>In the absence of that edge, in fact, it would produced two clicks on the string due to its initial sliding on finger and subsequent collision with the nail, resulting a bad sound.
>So even for the thumb, with the difference, due to its different position, that the contact point is located at the center of the edge."

>In order to achieve a full, or "fat" tone, we must give special attention to the angle of the fingertips to the string. **Note that when the fingers are initially placed on the strings, only the flesh makes contact. The nail makes its contact when pressure is applied**.

>The space between the contact point and the junction point must be backed from the nail, which has the following functions: A) **Attack to the string immediately after that  is stabilized by contact with fingertip.** B) Bend the string. C) Supplying to string, when the release begins, a sliding route  that avoid the risk of an instantaneous release.

From "**Ruggero Chiesa - Guitar Gradus**":

>Pluck the string with the fingertip **immediately next to the fingernail, which comes into action with a fast, short pulse**. The finger is brought inside, and immediately returns to the starting position.

From [Rob MacKillop Website](http://rmclassicalguitar.com/technique/):

>The fact is that nail-less playing demands a different technique to the one you learned before. 
The good news is that it is not a difficult technique, and once acquired you will have a strong-sounding technique, with a consistently good tone. 
No more worrying about the health and well-being of your nails, no more ping-pong balls (some will know what I mean!) or hours spent polishing and shaping.

>Do note that some flesh players grow their nails just long enough to provide support for the finger pad, but not long enough to make contact with the string. 
This might look like they are playing with a short nail, but that is not the case.
