From [Rob MacKillop Website](http://rmclassicalguitar.com/technique/):

>The fact is that nail-less playing demands a different technique to the one you learned before. 
The good news is that it is not a difficult technique, and once acquired you will have a strong-sounding technique, with a consistently good tone. 
No more worrying about the health and well-being of your nails, no more ping-pong balls (some will know what I mean!) or hours spent polishing and shaping.

>Do note that some flesh players grow their nails just long enough to provide support for the finger pad, but not long enough to make contact with the string. 
This might look like they are playing with a short nail, but that is not the case.
