Those who read my blog regularly already know my predilection for natural running (and often barefoot).

Running (a lot) in this way I reached the realization that  the equipment really has very little importance: if the foot stroke is good and the workout is correct, you can use any type of shoes, without noting any particular differences and without injuries. 

At least this is my personal experience and it could also be the **Yuki Kawauchi**'s mantra, that has ran an  half-marathon in 1 hour, 6 minutes and 42 seconds, [running  in a business suit](http://running.competitor.com/2016/03/news/yuki-kawauchi-runs-66-minute-half-marathon-in-a-suit_146754)! 

In music I'm noticing that the situation is very similar: in discussions between musicians (in person, on forums and groups on facebook) is a continuous flourishing of threads regarding instruments setup, strings type and tension, nail cutting, supports for guitar, ukulele strap (yes or no?).
